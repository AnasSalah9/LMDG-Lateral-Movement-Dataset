# LMDG: A Framework for Lateral Movement Datasets Generation

## Overview

This repository contains the code, data, and documents for the paper titled *"[LMDG: A Framework for Lateral Movement Datasets Generation]"*. Lateral movement (LM) attacks remain a significant challenge in cybersecurity, posing threats to network security and system integrity. Despite significant research efforts on detecting and mitigating these attacks, comprehensive and detailed datasets that accurately reflect the complexity of real-world lateral movement scenarios remain an unmet need. This paper introduces a novel approach to developing and evaluating lateral movement datasets, focusing on addressing the limitations of existing benchmark datasets. We conduct the first in-depth analysis of lateral movement in publicly available cybersecurity datasets, focusing on key aspects including attack diversity, number of hops, employed techniques, and labeling methodologies. Based on this analysis, we present a new benchmark dataset tailored for lateral movement detection, offering a more comprehensive and realistic representation of attack dynamics. To support this effort, we develop the LMDG framework, a reproducible solution that facilitates automated benign data generation, exclusion of new attack scenarios, and the critical task of labeling system and network logs. Additionally, our proposed process tree labeling method surpasses existing automatic labeling techniques, offering a more precise and scalable solution for effectively tracking the progression of lateral movement attacks. Through this work, we contribute a high-quality dataset and a robust, reproducible framework designed to aid in training, evaluating, and refining of lateral movement detection models. These contributions aim to advance the state of the art in Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) research, fostering the development of more effective and scalable solutions for detecting and mitigating lateral movement attacks.
